Question 1:(Section 2) If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
Answer:
It creates error. Because java does not allow casting like that.
To avoid error, we need to check instance of Media before casting.
For example, 
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    	if(obj instanceof Media) {
    		Media m = (Media) obj;
    		return this.id == m.id;
    	}else {
    		return false;
    	}
} 


Question 2:(Section 5)
Answer:
Before overriding, toString() method returns a string equal to the value of:
getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())

For example, I already added a CD into the list.
System.out.println() shows the result:
hust.soict.globalict.aims.media.CompactDisc@372f7a8d

After I override toString() method in each class DVD, CD and Book, they return strings equal to what i wrote.
For instance, toString() methods of Book and DVD:
ID: 3 - Book - Harry Potter - Magic - [] - Content length : 6: 2.05$
Token list: [but : 1, can : 5, cannot : 1, i : 1, me : 1, the : 2]
ID: 1 - DigitalVideoDisc - The Lion King - Animation - Roger Allers - 87: 19.95$ 

It's similar to equals() method which is also in Object class. Both are quite different from compareTo() and compare() methods that are in Comparable and Comparator interfaces.
