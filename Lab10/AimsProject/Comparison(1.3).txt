1. Compare the top-level containers in Swing and AWT

- They are JFrame, JPanel, JApplet.
- Swing needs a Container cp = getContentPane() to hold others containers while AWT does not.

2. Compare the class name of components in AWT and corresponding classâ€™s name in Swing

- They are quite similar.
- Swing has 1 more character 'J' before corresponding class name of components in AWT.

3. Compare the event-handling of Swing and AWT applications

- They are actually the same one because Swing uses event-handling of java.awt
- We need to import java.awt.event.ActionEvent and java.awt.event.ActionListener to use event-handling in Swing applications.
